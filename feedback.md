Overall Assessment: 2.5/5

Additional Comments: 

I can tell that you understand the relationships. However, your relationship methods are incomplete. Your `book.authors` and `author.books` methods are returning a list of `BookAuthors` when they should be returning a list of `Authors` and `Books` respectively. Be very careful when testing your code to make sure that you are getting the right return values.
